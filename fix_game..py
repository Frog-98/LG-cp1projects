#This program works by selecting a random number between 1-20 and setting the found condition to false.
#Then it has the player try to guess the number.
#Then it tests if the guess is correct, if it is correct it sets the win condition to true which ends the game. 
#If the number is too low or too high it tells the player that and then has them guess again.
